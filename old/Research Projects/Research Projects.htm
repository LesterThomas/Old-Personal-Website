             <p>
			The ability for anyone to make 'things' using cheap open-source hardware and software together with the croud-funding financing that removes any barrier to entry will drive new and unexpected innovations.
			These may come from unlikely sources - I wouln't be surprised if some of the next big-things originate from so-called developing-markets since the technology
			is now at a price-point that 10's of millions of hobbiests can experiment. </p>
			<p> My research is based on simple 'maker' projects using Arduino, Raspberry Pi using various shields for Cellular communication, 
			X10 home automation etc. It also includes wiring IoT 'things' using cloud services, Node.js and Node-Red.

             HTML5 
       </div>
       <div class="widget-text">
            <p>Although HTML has been around a lonmg time, the new technologies around HTML5, JQuery, JQuery Mobile, Restful APIs, Web Sockets, JSON, templates etc. will drive a new wave of applications with interfaces designed for many different formats. As an example, this homepage was developed using a <b>Responsive Web Design</b> approach (try changing the window size or viewing on different devices): 
			See <a href="Adaptive/adaptive webpage.htm" data-ajax="false">Responsive Design</a> for details of how this page is constructed.</p>
			<p>My research is in experimenting with these different development tools and approaches to understand the art-of-the-possible and imagine new application areas that these new approaches open up.</p>

            <p>
			Massive-scale architectures for Web using no-SQL databases, stateless applications, infrastructure-as-a-service and Platform-as-a-service to run applications in the cloud. </p>
			<p>My research is in testing different 
			PAAS approaches and platforms and understanding how they work, any limitations or constraints that they impose and what possibilities they open up.
